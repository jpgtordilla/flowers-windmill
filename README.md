Created a rotating windmill and flowers animation in JavaScript canvas. I was inspired by the Dutch language course that I took during the Fall semester of 2024.

Used canvas rotations and transformations for the animation. Drew all shapes using the line, rect, or ellipse tools. No external libraries used.
